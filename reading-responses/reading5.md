Accountability in society is a multi-dimensional topic, we see attempts to hold individuals accountable through the prison system, social media’s cancel-culture, and in the form of online public records. My personal philosophy on accountability is that while actions that cause permanent harm should have permanent consequences, other forms of restorative justice are possible. The records from the cases presented in the episode all leave a sense of shame or harm on the individual, and it puts a huge moral burden on the journalists deciding whether or not to remove their names. This relates to an important point brought up in the episode, which is the possibility of biases as the journalists were white and college-educated. I believe that if we were to create a task force that could eliminate tainted public records, the task force would have to be as diverse as possible, a diverse task force would be needed, and both parties of the victim and the offender would have to be involved. Another theme that stood out to me was forgiveness, as one person claimed that removing people’s names would enable them to ‘carry on with their lives without the baggage of the mistakes they’ve made’. I personally disagree with this perspective, and am in favor of this chance for individuals to access forgiveness after reconciling for their actions. 

I’ve listened to “the end of privacy as we know it” in the past, and what stood out to me both times listening was 1. the way that ClearView scrapes images from all forms of social media, and 2. that it is being scraped for profit and used in law enforcement. While the case discussed in the episode shows the pros of how the app could be used to find a child-abuse offender, I can also see the endless potential that this product of surveillance capitalism could have in furthering racial profiling. In the United States, police brutality, especially towards Black and Brown people, has been a major problem for many decades. With this algorithm in place, every corner of the internet is surveilled, adding yet another layer of threat to people’s (especially minority groups) existence. So it’s kind of ironic to me that the founder said that they wouldn’t sell ClearView to “bad actors”, as this technology landing in the hands of the white-supremist and corrupt U.S. law enforcement system is already a recipe for more excessive violence and civil rights violations.
