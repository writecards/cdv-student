To consider the ”context” of data means to take into account the supplementary information about a set of data, such as how the data was collected, and what it actually means. In the text by Boyd and Crawford, they bring up using Big Data to forge “artificial networks” and “behavior networks” through various data points from social media/internet users, in an attempt to make arguments about people’s connections. Boyd and Crawford stress the importance of context here, as large sets of numeric values alone based on “frequency or public articulation” cannot represent the complexities of interpersonal connections in real life (671). Lupi takes a personal approach in discussing the importance of context in visualizing data through her explanation of her Dear Data project. She argues that context is an essential portion of a data set in the way it reveals information about both the researcher and the participants. 

Both of the readings highlight the significance of including context in data representation, otherwise the data is hard to understand and loses meaning. Comparing the two, Lupi would agree with Boyd and Crawford when it comes to the size of data, as bigger does not always mean better. Boyd and Crawford argue this by highlighting the limitations to accountability in large data sets, making it difficult to remain objective (if that’s even possible). Lupi has the same argument and she encourages taking a more analog approach or working with smaller sets of data (data humanism?) in order to account for context and details that would otherwise get lost in a large dataset. Perhaps the two articles diverge in their perspectives on achieving “truth”—while both acknowledge the illusionary aspects of truth in Big Data, Boyd and Crawford take a more critical approach to questions on ethics and subjectivity in data, whereas Lupi argues that data can become closer to the “truth” if we learn to visualize our uncertainty. 

People or institutions can manipulate data by disregarding certain aspects of the context in order to produce a desired narrative. An example situation is the role of Asian Americans in the debate of affirmative action in college admissions—a set of policies that aim to help underrepresented groups. A common argument in this debate lumps the data from all Asian American together to paint a picture that Asian Americans are a very successful, high achieving group that does not need to be included in affirmative action policies. What this perspective fails to entail is the wide range of experiences among Asian American sub ethnic groups, which would reveal that data on east Asian and non-east Asian Americans college admissions would look drastically different.
