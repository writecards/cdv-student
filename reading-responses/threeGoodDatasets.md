[dataset of 170k+ Spotify songs](https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-160k-tracks)

This dataset is of 170k+ spotify songs released between 1921 and 2021. the songs have numrical data on features such as danceablility, tempo, energy, etc; and categories based on song name, artist name, release date, and the key of the song. I think this is a nice dataset because there is a lot of data to work with and it is also "clean" aka straight forward.

[All of Trump's Twitter insults from 2014-2021](https://www.kaggle.com/ayushggarg/all-trumps-twitter-insults-20152021)

This list documents the verbal attacks Mr. Trump posted on Twitter, from when he declared his candidacy in June 2015 to Jan. 8, when Twitter permanently barred him. The list includes date of the tweet, the target audience, the insult, and the tweet itself. Definitely an interesting dataset but I don't think I will work with it because I don't want to read Trump's tweets for 7 weeks lol.
