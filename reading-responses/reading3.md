Shoshana Zuboff coined the term “surveillance capitalism”, which I understand to be the commodification/datafication of human experiences. Essentially, our hobbies and interests and interacterations become behavioral data, which are collected through various engines on the internet, and fed to artificial intelligence algorithms to make predictions on how we will behave. This is seen for example in the way that social media sites like instagram track the types of accounts you interact with, and show you curated, targeted advertisements. Surveillance capitalism is also present in perhaps more subtle ways, such as the finite details of user interfaces on social media, which are designed to keep you engaged on the platform for as long as possible. One point that Zuboff touches on, which I really resonate with, is the way that surveillance capitalism operates as a “campaign of psychic numbing,” through which people aren’t exactly aware of the ways they are being datafied, or how their actions are being subtly manipulated by corporations, even though we technically “agree” to it in the privacy documents in the beginning of using a platform. The psychological effect of surveillance capitalism is seen through the addictive nature of social media, in which users (aka the data) spend hours upon hours on the apps, and usually they are not conscious of the fact that the social media platforms are not built to serve us, it is actually the other way around. Here, I think a quote by Edward Tufte fits pretty accurately: “There are only two industries that call their customers ‘users’: illegal drugs and software,” (Tufte, Netflix Social Dilemma). 

With my current understanding of how social media/surveillance capitalism works, I am wondering how it will be possible to “reimagine the digital without surveillance capitalism”. Zuboff refers a lot to democracy, but I find it challenging to comprehend how to organize when we’re under the systems/organizations that essentially control the internet. I am also particularly intrigued by the way China is mentioned towards the end of the Q&A session. Sure, China uses the power produced by surveillance capitalism to modify population behavior at scale, for its social/political goals. I can see this as a good thing in the way that people’s daily lives can be made more convenient, but the censorship and invasion of privacy involved can also be incredibly unsafe for minority communities at risk. I definitely think it would be interesting to learn more about the impacts of surveillance capitalism on various communities in China.
