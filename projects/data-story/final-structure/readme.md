  In recent years, the wildfire situation in California has become alarmingly destructive and severe. What exactly are the trends in California's wildfire data? Why do these patterns exist? Check out this page to find out more.

## The Process

- Why did you choose to visualize the data in this way?
- What can be seen in the visualization? Does it reveal something you didn't expect?
- Did you make crucial compromises? Which ones?
- If you had more time, what would you change, improve, add to the project?

- I approached this project with a focus on how to structure a visual narrative in order to make it appealing to the general reader. After exploring various formats, I decided to go with a "martini-glass" structure: key facts in the start (top 20 most destructive wildfires), followed by a chronology of events (attempted with the voronoi map), and a strong ending/kicker, which is the heatmap of all of the wildfires. Supplemented with text and images, I used this intentional structure in hopes of creating a narrative that is informative but not too overwhelming. By putting the visualizations in this order, I hoped to feed the reader's curiosity to find out more about the reasoning behind the data.

- The visualizations show the stark amount of wildfires in recent California history. I am not being dramatic when I say that I almost shed a tear when my heatmap visualization was finished - partially because I was surprised it actually worked - but mostly because it felt really devastating to visually absorb all of the wildfires laid out in front of me.

- I ended up making so many compromises for my viz... one of them being sacrificing a little bit of accuracy in the positioning of each wildfire in the final heatmap. Because of the way I drew the x-axis, the wildfires that occured in each month were all laid on top of each other. I had to settle with a random offset to make them spread out. (though there are definitely better ways to fix this).

- In terms of individual visualizations, for the first one I would change it to a force graph to better visualize the amount of wildfires occuring in each year (I don't know why I didn't think of this before). For the voronoi map, I would add the necessary update functions in order to get it to work. For the heatmap and ultimately the entire page, I would add animations to make the site more dynamic and also to improve the visibility of my data.

- Even though there is so so much more room to improve, I still feel very proud of the work I've got so far, and it is a project I definitely plan on contiueing to work on, both for data viz skills and for writing skills as well.
