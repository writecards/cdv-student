1. What data did you choose to collect?
-My data zine is a visualization of the stray cats I saw from late Januaray - end of February. 

2. How did you collect it, was was the routine?
-I collected various facts about my encounters with stray cats via a google form. I recorded the time of day, what I was doing, 
the cat's color, the cat's position in relation to me, and what the cat was doing. If I was alone when I saw the cat, I would open the
google form and record the information on the spot. However, if I was with other people or in a rush, I would snap a photo of the cat and record
the data when I got home. 

3. Why did you choose to visualize the data in this way?
-Since I am still learning d3.js, I wanted to create a visualization that was simple yet still explored the different functions d3 offers.
For the middle spread, I ended up with a grid of circles to loosely represent each cat. I used data functions to manipulate the position, stroke,
and color to coorelate with various features of the data. For the back page, on the left side I used a time scale to vizualize the cats across time,
and on the right I experimented with force simulations to group the cats by color. A note on the visualization of the cats by day on the left: their y-positions
are a little bit sporadic and a result of my use of the % function, but each column still represents how many cats I saw that day. I chose to keep this look
for the y-positions though, because I feel like it correlates with the surprise I felt when accidentally stumbling upon stray cats.
On the back page, I also intentionally omitted labels for the x-axis for design purposes, and rely on the text descriptions to communicate what each visualization is. While the final visualization looks quite simple, 
it was honestly a pretty challenging yet rewarding process to experiment with what d3 has to offer. 

4. What can be seen in the visualization? Does it reveal something you didn't expect?
-The visualization shows that the number of cats I see directly correlates to how often or how long I am outside. On the day that I saw the
most cats, I was on a 2 hour walk. So really it is a depiction of the cats I see, but more subtly of my activity. Through this project, I also 
discovered that a lot of cats were eating cat food, so it seems that people like to feed the cats and make sure they don't get hungry. On a couple of
occasions I saw the same cats multiple times, so I also learned that some cats have specific spots where they like to stay. 

5. Did you make crucial compromises? Which ones?
My compromises occured towards the end of the project when focusing on design - I initially had a color gradient to represent multi-colored cats, more circles in each cell on the middle
spread, and I also had triangles for cat ears. I ended up eliminating those features and completely changing my color scheme when I was creating the key and thinking about
the visual aesthetics of the zine. 

6. If this project had a larger scaler and wasn't designed for print, how would you imagine it to be? - I could imagine this project displayed on a large
interactive screen, with a much larger data set and more animations. I would also include more attributes to each data point, such as how I felt when seeing each cat, (cute, pitty, etc)
how the cat looked, or perhaps more information on the location of each cat sighting.
